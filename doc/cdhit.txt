# Note on CD-HIT-EST options that may be useful

cd-hit-est -i {input} -o {output} -c 1 -n 8 -r 1

# -c: cluster threshold as fraction (0.8-1) (sequence identity threshold, default: 0.9)
# -n: word size (8,9,10 for thresholds 0.9-1)
# -r: include reverse complements (0 = no, 1 = yes)
# -G: global sequence identity, default = 1. 0 = local
# -M: max available memory, default 400MB
# -aS: alignment coverage for the shorter sequence, default 0.0 (as fraction: 0.9 = 90%)
# -AS: alignment coverage for the shorter sequence as number of positions that may be missed
#      e.g.: value 2 for a sequence of 30 nucleotides means 30-2 = 28 nucleotides should be aligned, at least
# -T: threads, default 1; 0 = all available CPUs
# -g: fast mode (0, default), or slow but accurate mode (1)
# -sf: sort output fasta, default 0. 1: sort by decreasing cluster size.
# -d: length of description in .clstr file, default 20.
#      i.e. ID of fasta entries! if set to 0, stops at first space
