How to process output files

To extract the number of CRISPR spacers and operons from CCTyper's output,
the following files can be read:

Number of CRISPR-Cas loci may be obtained from `CRISPR_Cas.tab`: number of lines other than the header.
  - This file contains a prediction value (False, Ambiguous, True?) and type.
  - This file also contains the contig name and start and stop positions, which can be used
    to extract the sequence from the fasta file that was used as input.

Number of CRISPR spacers is in `crisprs_all.tab`; again remember to subtract the header line.
  - For the number of spacers near Cas-genes, there is `crisprs_near_cas.tab`.
  - This file contains contig names and start and stop positions per CRISPR which can be used
    to extract the sequence from the input fasta file.
  - These files also contain the number of repeats, spacer length, type, consensus sequence of the repeat,
    prediction scores and prediction result.

There is also a file with putative Cas operons, which we probably won't need, as this is already
automatically parsed and turned into the `CRISPR_Cas.tab` file. The file `cas_operons_putative.tab`
contains a list of predicted Cas operons with prediction scores. Those that are not 'False' seem
to go to `CRISPR_Cas.tab`.
