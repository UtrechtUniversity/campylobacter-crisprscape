## 1. Screening genomes for presence of CRISPR-Cas :octicons-search-16:

We screen each input genome for the presence of CRISPR-Cas loci using CCTyper.
CCTyper produces tab-separated output tables summarising results of:

1. Complete CRISPR-Cas systems (CRISPR + Cas locus)
2. Orphan CRISPR arrays (CRISPR spacers and repeats, without cas genes)
3. Cas operons (Any putative operon of cas genes, with or without CRISPR array)

It also saves the CRISPR spacer sequences as `.fa` file:
each array gets one FASTA file with spacers as separate entries/lines.

This is described in the `Snakefile` rule `crisprcastyper`.
The output files have the extension `.tab`.

### 1.1 Summarising the summaries :octicons-stack-16:

To facilitate further processing of the results reported by CCTyper,
we combine the most relevant results from the different `.tab` files
into one `.csv` file: `CRISPR-Cas.csv`. At the same time, the array/
operon names, start and stop positions and DNA sequence orientation
are collected and saved as `.bed` files.

This corresponds to rule `parse_cctyper`.
We do this using a custom script: [`bin/cctyper_expender.py`](bin/cctyper_extender.py).

### 1.2 Practical detail on processing ten thousands of genomes :octicons-number-16:

Since we are working with large numbers of genome files, these have
been separated in batches, each with up to 4,000 genomes. For each batch,
we concatenate the tabular files mentioned above. This is described in
`Snakefile` rule `collect_cctyper`.
This step concatenates the results from all `.tab` files in a batch,
the `.csv` file generated in [step 1.1](#11-summarising-the-summaries),
and the `.fa` files containing all separate CRISPR spacer sequences
as generated by CCTyper.

This step uses two custom bash scripts to concatenate tables in a way
that only one header line is used in the concatenated file:
[`bin/concatenate_cctyper_output.sh`](bin/concatenate_cctyper_output.sh) and
[`bin/concatenate_cctyper_csv.sh`](bin/concatenate_cctyper_csv.sh).
To concatenate the spacer fasta files, we simply use `cat`.

_Note that CCTyper reports putative cas operons._
_The `concatenate_cctyper_output.sh` script also makes a `.tab` file of_
_predicted 'true' operons as `cas_operons-[batch name].tab`._

### 1.3 Collect all identified CRISPR spacers :octicons-list-ordered-16:

After the concatenation of CCTyper's output files per batch, CRISPR
spacer sequences (as `.fa` files) for all batches are concatenated
in one batch with the rule `concatenate_all_spacers`.
This results in a single file `all_spacers.fasta` for all input genomes together.
